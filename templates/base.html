        managing your Google Ads account on your own for a while. Getting up and running may seem like a daunting task.
        And well, it kinda is…That’s why you’re here, right?</p>

    <p class="mt-3"><strong>Headlines</strong> – Google allows you to show up to three headlines with your ad. You want to take advantage of all
        three. Each headline allows for only 30 characters, so you’ll have to be creative and concise about
        communicating your message. Your headlines should address the product or service you are promoting and include
        a call to action (what you want the customer to do once they get to your website) at the very least.</p>

    <p class="mt-3"><strong>Display Path</strong> – The display path is part of the URL that is actually shown with your ad. This path does not have
        to match the Final URL. Use this field to give customers an idea of what page they will reach when they click
        on your ad. Using your keyword here (or the product or service you are promoting) is a good practice./<p>
    <p><strong>Descriptions</strong> – You have the ability to add up to two descriptions of 90 characters each. Here you can really
        go into more depth about your offering and your business.</p>
